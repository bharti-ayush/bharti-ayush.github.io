I am an Academy Research Fellow at the Department of Computer Science, Aalto University, supported by the Research Council of Finland. I lead the [Approximate Inference Lab](https://approximate-inference.github.io/) and am affiliated with the [Finnish Centre for Artificial Intelligence](https://fcai.fi/). Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher working with Prof. Samuel Kaski at Aalto University. I did my PhD from the Department of Electronic Systems, Aalborg University, Denmark on making approximate Bayesian computation methods for estimating parameters of stochastic models in the field of radio propagation ([Click here](https://www.turing.ac.uk/blog/using-machine-learning-improve-reliability-wireless-communication-systems) for more details). 

My primary research area is ***simulation-based inference*** (or likelihood-free inference). I am interested in developing approximate inference methods that are (i) robust to model misspecification, and (ii) computationally efficient. For more details on my work, see my [Publications](https://bharti-ayush.github.io/publications/) page or my [Google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=list_works&hl=en&hl=en&user=6_7vkiUAAAAJ&sortby=pubdate)
